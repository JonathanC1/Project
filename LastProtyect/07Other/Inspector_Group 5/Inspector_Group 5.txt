•	You have not created Gson files
•	In the call of the person class with 3 attributes of the indata method of the main class it is having problems because it does not recognize the two different constructors that are in the person class
•	In the first constructor, person calls only 3 attributes name last name and the plate and in the other it calls the attributes id, name last name and plate
•	Tests were made with the two constructors and with the first one there was an error with red letters and with the second one of the person class we had to delete the id attribute and that way it works to save the information in the csv file
•	in the teacher method of the main class in case 2 there is no find.csv file
