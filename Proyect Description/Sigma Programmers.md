Sigma Programmers
Overview
Our vision is to carry out a program which allows us to recognize license plate numbers,
based on a photograph, through a txt database that will inform us if the known license plate is
accepted for entry or not.
Objectives
1. Automatically identify alphanumeric characters from an image.
2. Convert the text that appears in an image into a text file, generating an input
confirmation.
3. Digitize the information.
Specifications
This project wishes to establish the use of technology through image recognition, to solve
certain problems that are established in people's daily lives, to facilitate certain actions and avoid
wasting time, as well as the security issue of the same.
It is compared from an image, based on True and False. When the image is correct, a
signal is generated, determining that it is true, and it will give a result "PLEASE ENTER", which
will have a time limit for entry. If the image does not match, a result will be displayed "DOOR
WAS NOT OPENED"
Background
In the university parking lot, cars enter using cards, which they recognize in a reader to
open the security bar, but the problem is that people often forget their card or find it difficult to
approach the card reader.
Solution
It is to establish IP cameras which recognize the plate with a sensor which determines if it
is a car on it so it will proceed to take a photograph, this image will be processed by software, I
sent said image to consult the database
 and identify if the compared data is in the system, activate the bar, otherwise there is no
activation.
Conclusions and recommendations
 1. We see that so far the margin of error of our project is still high, which we can
determine that we have a 25% error.
2. By controlling this type of treatment, the uses are quite acceptable and applicable in
several areas.
